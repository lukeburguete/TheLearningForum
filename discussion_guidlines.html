# Guidelines for productive discussion

- No inflammatory language (N-word, C-word, etc)
- Listen actively and respect others when they speak
- Avoid playing devil's advocate, this is rarely useful for discussion and is often a way for people to avoid responsibility for the views they hold
- There is a difference between agreement and understanding. When discussing complex social and institutional dynamics such as racism, consider whether “I don’t agree” may actually mean “I don’t understand.”
- The existence of racism, and other systematic forms of oppression, is not up for debate. We are here to deepen our understanding of how these systems are implemented and what our individual roles/interactions are within them
- We do not have to be aware of racism for it to exist, and bear in mind that our racial position (whether we identify as white, a person of colour, or multiracial) could greatly affect our ability to see racism
- We hope that people of colour will feel able to share their experiences and contribute their perspectives to these discussions, as we feel that listening to people who experience/have experienced oppression is an essential foundation for the kind of work that is needed here. That being said, no one will be expected to lead discussion, document their experiences with racism or explain the actions of other people of colour, nor will the validity of their experiences be dismissed or questioned. White people have no experience of racial oppression and therefore cannot challenge the experience of those who do
- This holds for any group that has experienced oppression, e.g. people who are not Jewish should not challenge someone's experience of anti-Semitism
- Please participate as much as possible, we all benefit by sharing our experiences
- Respect confidentiality within the group. Whilst we hope that the lessons we learn together will influence our discussion outside the group, please do not share any personal anecdotes or information without the explicit permission of the person(s) involved
