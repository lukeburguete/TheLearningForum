# Welcome to The Learning Forum

The Learning Forum is a discussion group that aims to engage in a constructive dialogue about issues of equality and inclusion, including but not limited to race, sex and gender, ability, and religion

We recognise that the responsibility for dismantling systems of oppression lies with those who benefit from them; and to acknowledge and pull apart such systems, we need to understand how they work and how we interact with them. Therefore, we aimed to create a space where we can support each other in the journey of self-education, acknowledging the need to centre the experience of people who have been marginalised and the need for non-marginalised people to take responsibility for driving these conversations

If you are interested in The Learning Forum and would like to find out more, please send us a message at l.burguete@bristol.ac.uk
